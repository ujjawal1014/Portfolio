# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
- It is with great pride and immense pleasure that I unveil my portfolio website, a testament to my dedication and skill in web development. This digital masterpiece has been meticulously crafted using the powerful combination of React, CSS, HTML, and Node.js. ðŸŒŸâœ¨ I invite you to explore and discover the fruits of my hard work and creativity. ðŸ’»ðŸ“±
